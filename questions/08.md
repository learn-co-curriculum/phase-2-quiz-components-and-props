# Lists and Keys

When should you use the `key` prop?

## Correct

When rendering an array of components.

> Correct! The `key` prop is a special prop that React uses to help optimize
> performance when rendering arrays of components.

## Incorrect

If two components are siblings.

> Not quite. The `key` prop is a special prop that React uses to help optimize
> performance when rendering arrays of components. React can render two sibling
> components just fine with no `key` prop provided:
>
> ```jsx
> function Parent() {
>   return (
>     <div>
>       <Sibling />
>       <Sibling />
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> ```

## Incorrect

Any time `.map` is used in a component.

> Not quite. The `key` prop is a special prop that React uses to help optimize
> performance when rendering arrays of components. While we often use the `key`
> prop when using `.map` to create an array of components, just using `.map` in
> a component isn't enough to indicate the need for the `key` prop.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
