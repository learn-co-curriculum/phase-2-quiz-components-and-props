# Components

Which of the following components are valid? Select all that apply.

## Correct

```jsx
function Card() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Reacth1>
      <p>Componentp>
    div>
  );
}
```

## Correct

```jsx
function Card({ title, subtitle }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}h1>
      <p>{subtitle}p>
    div>
  );
}
```

## Incorrect

```jsx
function card() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Reacth1>
      <p>Componentp>
    div>
  );
}
```

> This isn't a valid component, since all React components must start with a
> capital letter. Since `card` is lowercase, it's not a valid component, because
> React would treat this as a DOM element rather than a function component when
> rendered.

## Incorrect

```jsx
function Card() {
  <div>
    <h1>Reacth1>
    <p>Componentp>
  div>
}
```

> This is not a valid component because it doesn't return JSX. Functions defined
> with the `function` keyword must explicitly return using the `return` keyword.
