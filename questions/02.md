# Question

Which of the following components are valid?

## Correct

```
function Card() {
  return (
    
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
# React
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Component

  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 

  );
}
```

## Correct

```
function Card({ title, subtitle }) {
  return (
    
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
# {title}
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

{subtitle}

  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 

  );
}
```

## Incorrect

```
function card() {
  return (
    
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
# React
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Component

  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 

  );
}
```

> This isn't a valid component, since all React components must start with a
> capital letter. Since **card&nbsp;** is lowercase, it's not a valid component,
> because React would treat this as a DOM element rather than a function component
> when rendered:
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> ```
> ReactDOM.render(<card></card>, document.querySelector("#root"))
> 
> // 
>   
> // <card></card>  
> //
> ```

## Incorrect

```
function Card() {
  (
    
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
# React
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Component

  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 

  );
}
```

> This is not a valid component because it doesn't return JSX. Functions defined
