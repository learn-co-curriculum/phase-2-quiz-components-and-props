# Props

Given the following code, what would appear in the console?

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const header = "Hello";
  const contents = "World";

  return <Child title={header} body={contents} minutesToRead={10} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  console.log(props);
  // ... return JSX
}
```

## Correct

```javascript
{
  title: "Hello",
  body: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
```

> Correct! The `props` parameter in every component is an object of key/value
> pairs based on the attributes assigned by the parent component.

## Incorrect

```javascript
{
  header: "Hello",
  contents: "World",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
```

> Not quite. The **keys** on the `props` object are based on the attributes
> assigned by the parent component, which in this case are `title`, `body`,
> and`minutesToRead`.

## Incorrect

```javascript
{
  title: "header",
  body: "contents",
  minutesToRead: 10
}
```

> Not quite. The **keys** on this `props` object are correct, but the values are
> based on what data is held in each variable in the parent component, not the
> names of the variables.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
